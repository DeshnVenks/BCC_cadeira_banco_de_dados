('Soul Arrow', 'Fires a magical projectile. Excellent starting spell which does very good damage against most enemies in the early game areas.'),
('Great Soul Arrow', 'Stronger soul arrow, same cast time as soul arrow, fewer uses.'),
('Heavy Soul Arrow', 'Stronger than greater soul arrow, longer casting time.'),
('Great Heavy Soul Arrow', 'Stronger than heavy soul arrow, fewer uses. Has a slow cast time, but deals a tremendous amount of damage, even against bosses.'),
('Homing Soulmass', 'Fires multiple, homing magic projectiles. Can be successfully cast without an initial "lock on". Multiple soul arrows will hover above the player. Each individual soul arrow will seek the closest target, in the direction the player is facing, when in range. Because the spell can be cast in advance, it has a unique advantage in that, if timed correctly, it can be cast in synchronicity with other attacks.'),
('Homing Crystal Soulmass', 'Fires multiple, homing crystal projectiles. Can be successfully cast without an initial "lock on". Multiple crystal arrows will hover above the player. Each individual soul arrow will seek the closest target, in the direction the player is facing, when in range.'),
('Soul Spear', 'Fire piercing soul spear.'),
('Crystal Soul Spear', 'Fire an even more powerful, piercing ranged attack.'),
('White Dragon Breath', 'A straight line of crystals pop out of the ground in front of you, shooting towards your target. One advantage of this spell is that it will take out large groups of enemies if they are lined up one behind the other. It has a medium cast time, but once it fires, it will take out anything in its path. 20 casts make this a great high level replacement for the soul arrow at high levels, as its not as useful on most bosses.'),
